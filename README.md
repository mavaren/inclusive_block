# Inclusive Block

Fed up with this inclusive writing nonsense?
Install this nice little extension and your brain will thanks you.

## About

This extension has been developed mainly because I noticed how tedious
it was to read french inclusive-writing.

## Roadmap
- Ensure French detection before replacing.
I tried some scenarios using [Franc](https://github.com/wooorm/franc),
this might be useful for longer patterns but it is unable to properly
detect too small patterns such as ```content.js``` which is currently
replaced.
- More test examples
